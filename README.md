# Turkish Multiword Expression Lexicons

This repository contains part of the lexicons created during the study *"Integrating Morphology with Multiword Expression Processing in Turkish"*.
The majority of the lexicons from that study are dynamic and dependent on the morphological analyser used in the said study.
This repository provides the lexicons that are manually collected by Özlem Çetinoğlu and Orhan Bilgin.

There are two lexicons:

- Compound verbs as light verb constructions, e.g. *fink atmak*, *yerine getirmek*
- Lexicalised doubling pairs, e.g., *ağır aksak*, *derya deniz*.
Note that lexicalised doubling as repetition, e.g., *cıvıl cıvıl* or productive doubling as in repetition of adjectives, e.g. *ağır ağır*, is not part of this lexicon.

The lexicons provided in the repository are slightly altered versions of the original study. Some MWEs that do not belong to the respective lexicons are removed and some new MWEs are added. In total, there are 430 light verb constructions and 300 lexicalised doubling pairs. 

Please cite the publication below when you use the lexicons. For the MWE processor please contact Özlem Çetinoğlu.
